# Contributing to Playerse Localization

Playerse is a platform that connect and share with players around the world. We believe that gaming is a social experience, which language shouldn't be a barrier. We want to ensure that our platform is accessible to as many players as possible, which is why we rely on a team of volunteers to help us translate our platform into different languages.

## Getting Started

If you are interested in contributing to Playerse localization, follow these steps:

1.  Fork the [Playerse internalization repository](https://github.com/Playerse/internalization) to your own GitHub account.
2.  Clone your fork of the repository to your local machine..
3.  Choose the language you want to translate and create a new file named `<lang>.json`, where `<lang>` is the [ISO 639-1 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) for your language.
4.  Open the `<lang>.json` file and translate the strings in the file into your language. Please make sure to follow the same format as the original English strings and keep the placeholders in the translated strings intact.
5.  Once you have finished translating the strings, save the file and commit your changes to your fork of the repository.
6.  Submit a pull request to the `Playerse/internalization` repository, with your changes included in the pull request.

## Translation Guidelines

To ensure the quality and consistency of translations, please follow these guidelines when contributing to the Playerse localization project:

-   Use a professional, accurate, and consistent tone in your translations.
-   Use the appropriate style and formatting for your language, including punctuation, capitalization, and special characters.
-   Keep the length of translated strings similar to the original English strings, to ensure that they fit within the UI.
-   Do not translate proper names, brands, or technical terms unless they have a commonly accepted translation in your language.
-   Be mindful of cultural differences and avoid content that could be offensive or inappropriate in your language or culture.

## Translating Game Content

In addition to translating the strings in the translations , you may also be interested in translating game content, such as in-game text or voice lines. If you are interested in translating game content, please contact us at [localization@playerse.com](mailto:localization@playerse.com) for more information on how to get involved.
